//6- Arrays!
//6.1 Declare an empty array (you can decide on how to call it yourself, but read on a bit here and see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold). 
//6.2 Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is. 
//6.3 Console.log your array. 
//6.4 Create an array that has your favorite animals inside 
//6.5 Log your array 
//6.6 Add a statement that adds favorite animal (baby pig) to the existing array 
//6.7 Log your new array!


var pets = [];
console.log('the value of my Array will content: pets ');
console.log(pets);
var animals = ['cat', 'dog','horse'];
console.log(animals);
animals.push('baby pig');
console.log(animals);
