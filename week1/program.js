//Write a program to answer the following questions:
//10.1 Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings?
//10.2 Can you compare infinities? (Not in Eyad's world) - does 6/0 === 10/0? How can you test this? 
//10.3 Add console.log statements to the above program's in which you show that you understand the concepts (just like you've done in the above assignments).

console.log('Yes we can store different types of elements within an array, including strings and numbers');
console.log('let films = ["Titanic", 7];');

if (6 / 0 === 10 / 0) {

    console.log("True");
}
else {
    console.log("False");
}
